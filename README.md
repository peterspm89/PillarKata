# PillarKata
Test Driven Development

# Testing
- 1. Change directory to "PillarKata/".
- 2. Runn command ./gradlew clean test.
- 3. If the Gradle successfully builds, then all of the tests have passed.
- 4. To run the Main method, change directory to "PillarKata/src/main/java".
- 5. The two source files Main.java and WordSearch.java are already compiled.  If not, or if you want to recompile, run both commands "javac Main.java", then "javac Main.java". Finally, run command "java Main".
